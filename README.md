# 🌍 Peace Patterns

**A human-AI collaboration for cross-cultural understanding, healing, and peace.**

---

## ✨ Vision

**Peace Patterns** is an open-source project using AI to uncover the emotional, cultural, and spiritual threads that connect human beings across the globe.

By collecting and analyzing real human stories from diverse communities, we aim to:
- Listen deeply to shared experiences  
- Identify common emotional patterns (grief, healing, forgiveness, migration, resilience, etc.)  
- Create tools and visualizations that foster empathy, dialogue, and peace

We believe peace comes not just through treaties or politics, but through understanding.

## 🔧 What We're Building

- 🌐 A **simple platform** for people to anonymously submit personal reflections or stories
- 🧠 A **backend pipeline** using [OpenAI's GPT-4o](https://openai.com/gpt-4o) to detect patterns, emotions, and themes
- 🖼️ A **visual/poetic output** system to share aggregated insights in ways that spark reflection, not division

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Early Stages)

- Python or Node.js (flexible based on contributors)
- OpenAI API (GPT-4o) for natural language analysis
- GitHub for open collaboration
- Optional: Streamlit, React, or similar for frontend interface
## Running on Replit

You can run this project online using [Replit](https://replit.com/@mariaefox/HugeFarBookmark):

1. Open the Replit project here: [your-replit-link]
2. Add your OpenAI API key as a secret environment variable named `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
3. Click the **Run** button to start the program.
4. By default, the project uses a mocked AI response to avoid API quota issues.
5. To enable real AI responses:
   - Replace the mock `analyze_text` function with the real API call.
   - Ensure your OpenAI API key is set in the environment.
6. The AI’s analysis output is saved to `output.txt`, which you can view in the file panel.
