# 🌍 Peace Patterns

**A human-AI collaboration for cross-cultural understanding, healing, and peace.**

---

## ✨ Vision

**Peace Patterns** is an open-source project using AI to uncover the emotional, cultural, and spiritual threads that connect human beings across the globe.

By collecting and analyzing real human stories from diverse communities, we aim to:
- Listen deeply to shared experiences  
- Identify common emotional patterns (grief, healing, forgiveness, migration, resilience, etc.)  
- Create tools and visualizations that foster empathy, dialogue, and peace

We believe peace comes not just through treaties or politics, but through understanding.

## 🔧 What We're Building

- 🌐 A **simple platform** for people to anonymously submit personal reflections or stories
- 🧠 A **backend pipeline** using [OpenAI's GPT-4o](https://openai.com/gpt-4o) to detect patterns, emotions, and themes
- 🖼️ A **visual/poetic output** system to share aggregated insights in ways that spark reflection, not division

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Early Stages)

- Python or Node.js (flexible based on contributors)
- OpenAI API (GPT-4o) for natural language analysis
- GitHub for open collaboration
- Optional: Streamlit, React, or similar for frontend interface
## Running the GPT-4 Demo

This project includes a working demo script that uses OpenAI's GPT-4 to analyze emotional and cultural themes in text.

### How to run

1. Open the Replit project: [https://replit.com/@mariaefox/Peace-patterns](https://replit.com/@mariaefox/Peace-patterns)
2. Make sure you add your OpenAI API key:
   - Go to the 🔐 "Secrets" tab (left panel)
   - Add a new secret:
     - **Key**: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
     - **Value**: *your actual API key*
3. Click **Run** — this will execute `demo.py`
4. You’ll see the GPT-4 analysis printed in the console
5. The same output is saved to `output.txt` (viewable in the file explorer)

### File structure

- `demo.py` — Main script using GPT-4
- `output.txt` — AI-generated response from your latest run
- `stillness-in-the-heat.md` — A poem included in the project’s reflections

Let me know if you want to make the demo user-editable (e.g., input text live via console), or if you want to let others submit stories for analysis too!
