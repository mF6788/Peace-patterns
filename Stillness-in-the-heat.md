# Stillness in the Heat  
*for Sheriff and the soul beside him*

The sun lays heavy on the roof,  
and time forgets to move.  
A hush unfolds across the dayâ€”  
not silence, but a softened groove.  

Paws tucked under fur and breath,  
a sentinel at ease.  
No need to chase, no need to run,  
just listening to the trees.  

The world can wait, and so can thought,  
while shadows slowly bend.  
In stillness there is something said  
that noise cannot defend.  

So let the air be warm and slow,  
let prayers be soft and few.  
The holiest of afternoons  
is one spent next to you.
